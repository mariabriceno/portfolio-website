        Hi! I'm a front end engineer with six years of experience. I've worked
        on web development, web design and with almost any CMS you can think of.

      <p className="mb-4">
        I graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2016 with a degree
        in Human Communication, with the intention of starting a career in
        marketing. Very quickly I learned I enjoyed working on web design and
        development and got first position as a front end developer at a
        marketing agency in 2017.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If I really think about it, I'd say my career really started when I was
        11 years old and would spend my afternoons designing and building
        MySpace templates for my friends. You can say the rest is history.
